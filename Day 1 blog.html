    <h1>HTTP1.1 vs HTTP2.0</h1>
    <p>
        </p><h2>HTTP 1.1 </h2>
        Developed by Timothy Berners-Lee in 1989 as a communication standard for the World Wide Web, HTTP is a top-level application protocol that exchanges information between a client computer and a local or remote web server. In this process, a client sends a text-based request to a server by calling a method like GET or POST.
         In response, the server sends a resource like an HTML page back to the client.

        HTTP 1.1 - Version 1.1 was released in 1997 and became the Internet Standard.
         This version added many performance enhancements, such as keepalive connections, caching
         mechanisms, request pipelining, transfer encodings, and byte range requests.

    <p>
        </p><h2>HTTP 2.0 </h2>
        HTTP/2 began as the SPDY protocol, developed primarily at Google with the intention of reducing web page load latency by using techniques such as compression, multiplexing, and prioritization. This protocol served as a template for HTTP/2 when the Hypertext Transfer Protocol working group httpbis of the IETF (Internet Engineering Task Force) put the standard together, culminating in the publication of HTTP/2 in May 2015. From the beginning, many browsers supported this standardization effort, including Chrome, Opera, Internet Explorer, and Safari. Due in part to this browser support, there has been 
        a significant adoption rate of the protocol since 2015, with especially high rates among new sites.
        HTTP 2.0 - Released in February 2015 by the Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF)
         focussed on improving the performance of HTTP. 
        This article focuses on the major changes of this version in more detail.
    <p></p>
    <p>
        The key differences HTTP/2 has to HTTP/1.x are as follows:
</p><ul>
<li>It is binary, instead of textual</li>
<li>It is fully multiplexed, instead of ordered and blocking</li>
<li>It can use one connection for parallelism</li>
<li>It uses header compression to reduce overhead</li>
It allows Server Pushing to add responses proactively into the Browser cache.</ul>
